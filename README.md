# Contagion-Project
Final major university project.

Contagion is a multiplayer infectious disease game in which one player has to infect others in increasingly complex environments. My aim with this project was to see if meaningful data could be taken and ascertain whether multiplayer games could be a meaningful method of helping predict disease transmission.
